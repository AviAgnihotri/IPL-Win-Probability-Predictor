# Welcome to the IPL Win Probability Predictor! This program is designed to predict the win probability of a team in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match based on historical data.

To use this program, follow the steps below:

_*Data Collection:*_

First, you need to collect the historical IPL match data from a reliable source. You can use any database or API that provides the necessary data, or you can create your own dataset by scraping data from various sources.
The data should include the team names, runs scored by each team, wickets taken by each team, the venue of the match, the date of the match, and other relevant information that you want to use in your analysis.

_*Data Preparation:*_

Once you have collected the data, you need to preprocess and clean it to ensure that it is suitable for analysis.
The program requires a specific format of data to work properly. The data should be in the form of a CSV file with the following columns:
'Team A': The name of the first team playing the match
'Team B': The name of the second team playing the match
'Venue': The name of the stadium where the match is being played
'Date': The date of the match in the format "yyyy-mm-dd"
'Winning Team': The name of the team that won the match
'Win Margin': The margin by which the winning team won the match
'Toss Winner': The name of the team that won the toss
'Toss Decision': The decision made by the toss-winning team ('bat' or 'field')
'Match Type': The type of match (e.g., 'Qualifying Final', 'Eliminator', 'Final', etc.)
You can use any data preparation tool or software of your choice to preprocess the data and save it in the required format.

_*Running the Program:*_

Once you have prepared the data, you can run the IPL win probability predictor program.
The program is written in Python and requires the following Python libraries to be installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and joblib.
Open the 'IPLWinProbabilityPredictor.ipynb' file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or run the 'IPLWinProbabilityPredictor.py' file from the command line to run the program.
Follow the instructions in the program to load the data and make predictions for a given match.

_*Interpreting the Results:*_

The program will output the win probability of each team based on the historical data.
The output will be a float value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the corresponding team winning the match.
A probability value closer to 1 indicates a higher chance of winning for that team, while a value closer to 0 indicates a lower chance of winning.
Thank you for using the IPL Win Probability Predictor!
